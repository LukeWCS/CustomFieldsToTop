### 1.0.1 (2021-03-18)
Fixes:
* JS: The check whether the parameter CustomFields contains values ​​was incorrectly defined and incorrectly positioned. However, due to the incorrect definition, the error had no visible effects.
* PHP: The minimum Mantis version was defined incorrectly. That was forgotten during the compatibility test.
